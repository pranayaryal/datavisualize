<p>An investigator is planning a study to determine if a novel, week-long intervention can improve fine motor function in children. The variable she will be measuring is the score on a standard fine motor skills test. The developers of the fine motor skills test report that an improvement in test score of 5 units represents clinically meaningful change, (i.e.) notable improvement in fine motor function. She will conduct her hypothesis test at significance level α = .05 and desires the Type II error rate to be β = 0.20. </p>

<p>(a) In one design of the study, the investigator plans to randomly assign children to one of two groups – the novel intervention or a gold standard intervention. If she can assume a pooled standard deviation of 9, how many children (in total) will she need to recruit to achieve the desired Type II error rate under this design?
   = 25.4016</p>

<p>(b) In an alternative design, the investigator will give the fine motor skills test to a single group of children, administer the novel intervention to all of these children, and then give the fine motor skills test again. If she can assume a standard deviation of the differences of 12, how many children (in total) will she need to recruit to achieve the desired Type II error rate under this design?</p>

<p>Sample size = 45.1584</p>

<p>(c) In the alternative design of part (b), suppose only 80% of the children that take the pre-intervention motor skills test will be available to take the post-intervention motor skills test. How many children must she recruit for the alternative design of part (b) in order to ensure that the number of students that take the pre-test and post-test will equal the sample size you calculated in part (b)?
     56.448</p>

<p>d) Accounting for the loss of subjects for the paired design noted in part (c), which design would you recommend to the investigator and why?
  Don't know</p>

<ol>
<li>An analyst/therapist is interested in determining if a novel therapeutic relaxation tech- nique can reduce the incidence of anger-related episode in a population of individuals court- ordered to anger-management therapy. He randomly selects 50 individuals undergoing anger- management therapy, and documents the number of self-reported anger-related episodes for one month. He then administers the relaxation technique daily for one week to each individ- ual, and then documents the number of self-reported anger-related episodes for one month after.</li>
</ol>

<p>(a)State the null and alternative hypotheses for the test the analyst/therapist will conduct**</p>

<p>$H_0$: Self-reported anger-related episodes is not affected by relaxation technique $(\mu_d \ge 0)$</p>

<p>$H_a$ : self-reported anger-related episodes is affected by relaxation $(\mu_d &lt; 0)$</p>

<p>(b)<strong>The average change in the number of anger-related episodes from before to after the in- tervention was -3.2. The sample standard deviation of the difference was 12.1. Calculate the test statistic</strong></p>

<p>test statistic =  -0.8428</p>

<p>(c)State the decision rule for a level α = .05 test. Potentially useful percentiles include t49(.05) = −1.68, t49(.025) = −2.01, t98(.05) = −1.66, t98(.025) = −1.98**</p>

<p>Accept null hypothesis</p>

<p>(e)
pvalue = 0.05
(f)Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in anger-related episodes.
        -4.2816, 2.596</p>

<p><strong>4. For the following, answer TRUE or FALSE</strong></p>

<p>(a) The p-value for a two-sided test can be calculated from a one-sided p-value by multiplying the one-sided p-value by two.</p>

<p>(b) The critical value for a hypothesis test is determined by the reference distribution and the value of the type II error rate β.</p>

<p>(c) The null hypothesis for any one-sample test of means specifies only one possible value for the population mean.</p>

<p>(d) For a given data set, an analyst has rejected the null hypothesis H0 : μ ≤ 250 with a level α = .05 test. The 95% confidence interval for μ is (249.2, 271.8). Based on these results, the analyst has miscalculated something.
(e) Decreasing the Type II error rate will decrease the sample size requirement for a hy- pothesis test.
(f) An administrator wants to determine if mean ACT scores from in-state university appli- cants (μin) are greater than mean ACT scores from out-of-state applicants (μout). The null hypothesis for such a test would be H0 : μin &gt; μout.
(g) Increasing the detectable difference in a sample size calculation will decrease the sample size, holding all other variables constant.
(h) If the pre-intervention and post-intervention measurements in a paired samples study are both normally distributed according to the Shapiro-Wilk test, then the paired samples t-test is appropriate.
(i) When the null hypothesis is accepted in a statistical hypothesis test, this means the null hypothesis is true.</p>

<p>(e) Suppose that it is known that the probability of rolling a 6 on a loaded die is 0.50. You conduct an experiment by rolling the die 500 times, and based on the results, reject the null hypothesis H0 : p = 0.50.</p>

<p><strong>7. A biological engineer has developed a new training protocol for teaching mice to negotiate a maze, in the hopes of reducing the variability in the time to complete the maze. He randomly assignes 15 mice to receive the new protocol and 20 mice to receive the old protocol. In the 15 mice receiving the new protocol, he observes a variance of 124.

Consult the formulas on the following pages to see how.\r\n- The percentile additionally depends on the level of confidence, (e.g.) 90%, 95%, 99%, etc.\r\n- Remember that this heuristic formula does not apply for confidence intervals for variances and\r\nratios of variances.\r\n\r\nInterpretation\r\n\r\nThe confidence interval contains the unknown population quantity (mean, difference in means, proportion, difference in proportions, etc.) being estimated with a certain probability. More practically speaking, points inside the confidence interval represent “plausible” values for the unknown population quantity. Points outside the confidence interval are not plausible.\r\nConfidence intervals are often used with “benchmark” values for the quantity being estimated. If the benchmark lies in the confidence interval, then the benchmark is a plausible value. If the benchmark lies outside the confidence interval, then the benchmark is not a plausible value.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hypothesis Tests</strong>\r\n\r\n*The Hypothesis Testing Process*\r\n\r\nKnow and be able to execute (most) the steps of the hypothesis testing process:\r\n\r\n1.
